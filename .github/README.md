```

## Configuring

By default, no configuration is needed.

But there are some optional environmental variables that you can set to give you access to some additional checks, or to increase rate-limits for some checks that use external APIs.

<details><summary><b>API Keys & Credentials</b></summary>

Key | Value
---|---
`GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` | A Google API key ([get here](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs/authenticate-api-keys)). This can be used to return quality metrics for a site
`REACT_APP_SHODAN_API_KEY` | A Shodan API key ([get here](https://account.shodan.io/)). This will show associated host names for a given domain
`REACT_APP_WHO_API_KEY` | A WhoAPI key ([get here](https://whoapi.com/)). This will show more comprehensive WhoIs records than the default job

<details>
  <summary><small>Full / Upcoming Vals</small></summary>
  
- `GOOGLE_CLOUD_API_KEY` - A Google API key ([get here](https://cloud.google.com/api-gateway/docs/authenticate-api-keys)). This can be used to return quality metrics for a site
- `REACT_APP_SHODAN_API_KEY` - A Shodan API key ([get here](https://account.shodan.io/)). This will show associated host names for a given domain
- `REACT_APP_WHO_API_KEY` - A WhoAPI key ([get here](https://whoapi.com/)). This will show more comprehensive WhoIs records than the default job
- `SECURITY_TRAILS_API_KEY` - A Security Trails API key ([get here](https://securitytrails.com/corp/api)). This will show org info associated with the IP
- `CLOUDMERSIVE_API_KEY` - API key for Cloudmersive ([get here](https://account.cloudmersive.com/)). This will show known threats associated with the IP
- `TRANCO_USERNAME` - A Tranco email ([get here](https://tranco-list.eu/)). This will show the rank of a site, based on traffic
- `TRANCO_API_KEY` - A Tranco API key ([get here](https://tranco-list.eu/)). This will show the rank of a site, based on traffic
- `URL_SCAN_API_KEY` - A URLScan API key ([get here](https://urlscan.io/)). This will fetch miscalanious info about a site
- `BUILT_WITH_API_KEY` - A BuiltWith API key ([get here](https://api.builtwith.com/)). This will show the main features of a site
- `TORRENT_IP_API_KEY` - A torrent API key ([get here](https://iknowwhatyoudownload.com/en/api/)). This will show torrents downloaded by an IP
  
</details>

</details>

<details><summary><b>Configuration Settings</b></summary>

Key | Value
---|---
`PORT` | Port to serve the API, when running server.js (e.g. `3000`)
`API_ENABLE_RATE_LIMIT` | Enable rate-limiting for the /api endpoints (e.g. `true`)
`API_TIMEOUT_LIMIT` | The timeout limit for API requests, in milliseconds (e.g. `10000`)
`API_CORS_ORIGIN` | Enable CORS, by setting your allowed hostname(s) here (e.g. `example.com`)
`CHROME_PATH` | The path the Chromium executable (e.g. `/usr/bin/chromium`)
`DISABLE_GUI` | Disable the GUI, and only serve the API (e.g. `false`)
`REACT_APP_API_ENDPOINT` | The endpoint for the API, either local or remote (e.g. `/api`)

</details>

All values are optional.

You can add these as environmental variables. Either put them directly into an `.env` file in the projects root, or via the Netlify / Vercel UI, or by passing to the Docker container with the --env flag, or using your own environmental variable management system

Note that keys that are prefixed with `REACT_APP_` are used client-side, and as such they must be scoped correctly with minimum privileges, since may be made visible when intercepting browser <-> server network requests

## Why this Fork?

While [Web Check](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check) will **always** remain 100% free and open source, the work on the upstream repo at the moment is more geared towards making the managed instance as scalable and cost effective to run at scale as possible. This includes features for advanced rate-limiting, user signup and billing. This new work adds excess overhead for those who just want to host their own instance on the cloud or locally.

To solve this, we cut this repo from [Web-Check:1.0.0](https://github.com/Lissy93/web-check/tree/1.0.0), to keep it free and easy for anyone who wants to self-host their own instance of Web Check.

If you'd rather not deploy your own, and would just like to use the public instance, you can do so at **[web-check.xyz](https://web-check.xyz/)**.
